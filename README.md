# Weather-Dashboard---Module-8-Challenge

My motivation for this project is to create a weather dashboard for people to search and view weather from around the world.

I would like a dashboard that when a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

This dashboard will display the current city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity and the wind speed. It will also display a 5 day forcast for the same city and when a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
